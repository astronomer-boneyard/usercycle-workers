npm install systemjs works good - can dynamically traverse directory and load modules, then add handlers.
trying to do a normal import in a system.imported file - modulues cant be found



TODO:
lua scripts
queue level events - use instead of mixins for progress
calculate rolling avg time - use to delay jobs


ISSUE:
some jobs execute multiple times, or job with matching data
only happens with multiple processes
all jobs that get queued, are required before data is correct
